## Project objective
In this project, I used the popular Express web application framework and a SQL database to create a REST API that lets users create, list, update, and delete items from a school database.


<!-- In this project, I was given HTML designs and an existing SQLite database. I was required to implement a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize. The application includes pages to list, add, update, and delete books from an SQLite database.

I used Sequelize to access the data in the library.db SQLite database file. Express.js routes were created to handle the needed url requests, with corresponding Pug template files. Sequelize methods are used to create, read, update and delete data from the SQLite database. Sequelize model validation is used for validating form fields. -->


<!-- ## Techniques and tools
- Sequelize
- SQLite database
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Pug template engine
- npm -->

<!-- ## Code example
Using the Book object to access the Sequelize book.js model, along with the Sequelize `.findByPk()` method to retrieve the book data we're looking for.

```javascript
/* GET individual book */
router.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
	Book.findByPk(req.params.id)
		.then(function(book) {
			if(book) {
				res.render('update-book', { book: book, title: book.title });
			} else {
				res.render('error');
			}
		})
		.catch(function(err) {
			res.render('error');
		});
});
``` -->
